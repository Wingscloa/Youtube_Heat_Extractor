## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
To use the YouTube Video Downloader, run the `main.py` script with the necessary arguments:
```bash
python main.py [OPTIONS]
```

### Options
- `--url`: Enter the YouTube URL of the video.
- `--clip`: Specify the duration (in seconds) of the final clip.
- `--name`: Specify the name of the final clip.

## Features
- Download videos from YouTube.
- Support for creating clips of specified duration.
- Automated browser interactions using Selenium.
- Web scraping capabilities with BeautifulSoup.
- Video processing and conversion with FFmpeg.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python packages:
- `selenium`
- `webdriver-manager`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pytube`
- `ffmpeg-python`
- `argparse`

These can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
Make sure to have the appropriate web driver installed for Selenium to work correctly. The `webdriver-manager` can be used to automate this process.

## Examples
Here are some example commands to use the tool:

1. Download a video and create a 30-second clip:
    ```bash
    python main.py --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example" --clip 30 --name "example_clip"
    ```

2. Download a video and create a 60-second clip:
    ```bash
    python main.py --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example" --clip 60 --name "example_clip"
    ```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with web drivers, ensure they are up-to-date and compatible with your browser version. The `webdriver-manager` package can assist with managing web driver versions.
